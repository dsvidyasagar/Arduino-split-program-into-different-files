# Arduino split program into different files
This project contains the split up of simple LED blinking code into 3 different files. Fork it to create more functionality in it.
## The header file
This file includes the #ifndef statements and the prototypes of the user defined functions.
## CPP file
It includes the implementation codes of your user defined functions.
### Download & Run
Download the folder and open the BlinkLED.ino file in Arduino IDE.<br>
Then verify the code and upload it into your Arduino UNO or Arduino NANO board.
